            <li>Sunnyvale, CA</li>
            <li>Tracy, CA</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I currently live in Lee's Summit, MO since I'm currently
            stationed here in Missouri and I really enjoy the town a
            lot. I lived in Sunnyvale, CA for a year when I went back
            to school and enjoyed being so close to a lot of neat
            places. I've lived most of life in Tracy, CA which is my
            hometown.

            San Diego, CA is a beach town I love visiting a few times
